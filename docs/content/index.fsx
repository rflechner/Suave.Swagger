- [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a usefull tool helping to create interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.


Why use Swagger?
-------------------

- Generate beautiful API documentation, including a UI to explore and test operations.
- Improve productivity during development.
- Make it possible for API users to generate clients.


Project
-------

This is a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) to document Suave web services with Swagger.
[Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) is embedded in resources and a `WebPart` serving it is automatically added.
